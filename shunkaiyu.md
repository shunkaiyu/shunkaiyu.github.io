### About me

I will quote a saying from Steve Jobs here:

>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." 

In HW1, I use commands following:
```
git clone
git branch
git add
git commit
```

Things I like:

- Reading
- Party
